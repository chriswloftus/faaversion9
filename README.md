# README

Code for the CS31620 FAA (Feline Adoption Agency) app, version 9. Ready to use.

This is a Kotlin project.

This is version developed by students in workshop 19.

This version adds an AddCat fragment that is activated
when the CatsFragment FAB is pressed. It starts the camera app on a real phone.
This won't work on the emulator unless it is configured to support the emulated camera.
